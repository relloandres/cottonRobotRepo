navigationType:
    - 0: There are always two perpendicular walls in Lidar FoV.
        In this case the following constants are needed:
            - verticalNavigation: Specifies the wall that will be used to define position in the y-axis
            - horizontalNavigation: Specifies the wall that will be used to define position in the x-axis at the start of the cycle. At the end of the cycle the opposite wall will be used
            - startPoint: Point where the robot will navigate at the start of the cycle. 
            - finalPoint: Point where the robot will navigate at the end of the cycle.
            - setOrientationTheta: Specifies the wall that will be used to set the correct orientation of the robot at the end of the cycle
     - 1: There is only the East-West wall in Lidar FoV
        In this case the following constants are needed:
            - horizontalNavigation: Specifies the wall that will be used to define position in the x-axis at the start of the cycle. At the end of the cycle the opposite wall will be used
            - startPointX: Point in the horizontal direction where the robot will navigate at the start of the cycle. 
            - startPointTheta: Defines in which direction the lidar should look to find columns to define its vertical position
            - finalPoint: Point where the robot will navigate at the end of the cycle.
            - setOrientationTheta: Specifies the wall that will be used to set the correct orientation of the robot at the end of the cycle
