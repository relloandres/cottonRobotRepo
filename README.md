## Directory description

Directory: ./testData/16-june
First set of data taken using LIDAR connected to raspebrrypi. The names of the files corresponds to the position of the lidar which can be checked in the file dataMap.png (where p is the wall with the blackboard). The files with and h at the end of the name where taken at the height of the cotton balls. In some files there will be points corresponding to the legs of the person holding the LIDAR, hopefully this points will be easy to spot and leave out of the analysis.
